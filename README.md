geYo
==

Send your location to your friends with one tap, and see where everyone else is tapping! A geYo is a quick notification or update of your location that you send to your friends. A beautiful Google Map view on our websites will show you a simulation of where other people are geYoing and our Android App will allow you to quickly and easily send and receive geYos from your friends. 

We were inspired by the new app Yo. The quick notification and user experience is revolutionarily simple but left us craving a little bit more information. We chose location as that additional context, and we're really proud of the progress we were able to make in 48 hours. Our targets users are general teens and college students, but we can definitely envision adults using our app once we iron out the user interface. We worked really hard to keep the workflow and user experience as simple and clean as possible; anyone can use your app for any reason they can think of!
